# Knockout Style Guide
This is an opinionated style guide for KnockoutJS syntax, best practices, ease of use and understanding code, structuring large KO applications. They are designed for making the code testable, reusable and flexible for large scale development. 

## Contribution
I would invite the community to add their best practices and make learning Knockout a quick and easy job along with quality coding. You can also provide your feedback on the listed practices and we are always open to accept the best reasonable answer.

## Purpose
This style guide will be a list of guidelines on how to structure Knockout code and what things are needed to be considered while building a MVVM application. Inviting other users to share their knowledge. [@TheTanna](//twitter.com/TheTanna)

This guide is explicitly for syntax, conventions and structuring of the Knockout Application. These are based on my experience working with this framework and delivering trainings as wells as seminars. If you wish to learn some basics about Knockout, please refer to the documentation [KnockoutJS](//knockoutjs.com/)

##Open Community
You will never learn alone from your own business scenarios. Go to [StackOverflow - KnockoutJS](//stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/knockout.js) where you'd come accross thousands of questions describing various scenarios of other people. If you cannot contribute, you can gain some knowledge from their questions. 

##Guide
All we need to know is where to use which feature and how it would be useful to us. Once we know this then we would be able to fit the leggo bricks of a giant structure very easily.

##Before you proceed
I'd like you to have a look at this beautifully crafted answer on StackOverflow about [MVC vs MVVM](//stackoverflow.com/questions/667781/what-is-the-difference-between-mvc-and-mvvm) which explains a minute difference about frameworks like AngularJS and KnockoutJS

It states that "in MVVM, controllers will typically contain all processing logic and decide what data to display in which views using which view models." If you're wondering where did "C"ontroller came from, this means your data mappers which process the raw JSON coming from server and shape it into logical/meaningful grouping of data. Controllers listen for, and publish, events. Controllers provide the logic that controls what data is seen and where. Controllers provide the command code to the ViewModel so that the ViewModel is actually reusable.

So basically, this is what diagramattically happens in a large Knockout Application:
![MVVM Knockout Application Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankittanna/knockout-style-guide/master/Slide1.PNG)

The diagram is self explanatory. 

In the diagram, we have seen the following role players:
    1. Information holder – an object designed to know certain information and provide that information to other objects.
    2. Structurer – an object that maintains relationships between objects and information about those relationships.
    3. Service provider – an object that performs specific work and offers services to others on demand.
    4. Controller – an object designed to make decisions and control a complex task.
    5. Coordinator – an object that doesn’t make many decisions but, in a rote or mechanical way, delegates work to other objects.
    6. Interfacer – an object that transforms information or requests between distinct parts of a system.

## Single Responsibility

Every ViewModel will focus on very few things. Functions will be smaller and dedicated to do one and only one task. Every ViewModel should be written in its own JavaScript file. The build process can be configured to concatinate and minify them. Hence we have to implement the Model-View-View-Model pattern using the Knockoutjs framework to clearly separate the logic that drives the workings of UI from the logic that provides the data/behavior for the UI.

This promotes reusability as well as modularity. Smaller files are focused files and do not get impacted by the bugs else where.
This will also enable you to have lose coupling between your modules.
This makes unit testing easy.

*Rules:*
    1. One Component per file
    2. Less than 500 lines per file
    3. Readable, maintainable and avoids conflicts in source control
    4. Decouples tasks
    5. For a single Knockout Component, we can break it into: 
        - View (html)
        - ViewModel (JavaScript)
        - Service (JavaScript)
        - Domain Models (JSON Objects) - Interfate to View Model
        - Models (JSON Objects) - Structure of Various objects
        - Styles (CSS)
    
### Style 1 
#### Not Recommended

```javascript
define(['knockout'], function(ko) {

                var toMoney = function(num){
            return '$' + (num.toFixed(2).replace(/(\d)(?=(\d{3})+\.)/g, '$1,') );
        };
                ko.bindingHandlers.money = {
                    update: function(element, valueAccessor, allBindings){
                            var $el = $(element);
                            var method;

                            // Gives us the real value if it is a computed observable or not
                            var valueUnwrapped = ko.unwrap( valueAccessor() );

                            if($el.is(':input')){
                                method = 'val';
                            } else {
                                method = 'text';
                            }
                            return $el[method]( toMoney( valueUnwrapped ) );
                        }
                };

            function SampleViewModel() {
                // ... Some tasks here
            }

            return SampleViewModel;
        });
```

#### Recommended

*someViewModel.js*
```javascript
define(['knockout'], function(ko) { 
   function SampleViewModel() {
      // Some tasks here
   }

    return SampleViewModel;
});
```

*money-binding.js*
```javascript
define(['knockout'], function(ko) {
var toMoney = function(num){
   return '$' + (num.toFixed(2).replace(/(\d)(?=(\d{3})+\.)/g, '$1,') );
};

    ko.bindingHandlers.money = {
        update: function(element, valueAccessor, allBindings){
                var $el = $(element);
                var method;

                // Gives us the real value if it is a computed observable or not
                var valueUnwrapped = ko.unwrap( valueAccessor() );

                if($el.is(':input')){
                    method = 'val';
                } else {
                    method = 'text';
                }
                return $el[method]( toMoney( valueUnwrapped ) );
            }
    };
}
```

### Style 2 - Small Functions
- Less than 75 lines of code
- Easy to test
- Easy to read
- Easy to maintain
- Reusable
- Avoid bugs and SVN collisions

### Style 3 - IIFE or RequireJS modules
Using IIFE methods or RequireJS module helps. Wrapping the components in IIFE or RequireJS modules help you have the code covered in a particular scope. They remove variable from global scope. RequireJS helps in implementing AMD. This will define variable scope for each module. Also when we club these files together, collisions of variables would be avoided.

```javascript
(function(ko) {
ko.bindingHandlers.money = {
   update: function(element, valueAccessor, allBindings){
     var $el = $(element);
        var method;

                // Gives us the real value if it is a computed observable or not
                var valueUnwrapped = ko.unwrap( valueAccessor() );

                if($el.is(':input')){
                   method = 'val';
                } else {
                   method = 'text';
                }
                return $el[method]( toMoney( valueUnwrapped ) );
            }
    };
})(knockout);

///////////////////////////// OR /////////////////////////////

define(['knockout', function(ko) {
ko.bindingHandlers.money = {
   update: function(element, valueAccessor, allBindings){
     var $el = $(element);
        var method;

                // Gives us the real value if it is a computed observable or not
                var valueUnwrapped = ko.unwrap( valueAccessor() );

                if($el.is(':input')){
                   method = 'val';
                } else {
                   method = 'text';
                }
                return $el[method]( toMoney( valueUnwrapped ) );
            }
    };
}]);
```

## Modules and Patterns
Use RequireJS Modules or IIFE to create small files - also known as modules. These modules will have a single responsibility which it needs to perform. This responsibility should be exposed through an API of the module. 

Modules help us to implement Separations of Concerns principle and meaningfully and consistently structure our application. Unit testing becomes easier and independent.

There are couple of patterns we can adopt during development.
1. Prototype Pattern
2. Module Pattern
3. Revealing Module Pattern

### Prototype Pattern
This pattern creates a constructor function and a prototype to it. Each object that is created from the constructor will act as a module and will encapsulate its functionality.

```javascript
function ObjectName(parameters) {
   // create instance functionality
}

ObjectName.prototype = {
   // create prototype functionality
};

```

*Example*

```javascript
var Car = function(type) {
   this.speed = ko.observable();
   this.type = type || 'no-type';
}

Car.prototype = {
   drive: function(speed) {
      this.speed(speed);
   }
}

var car = new Car('BMW');
car.drive(60);
```

#### Pros
- Uses built in JavaScript Features
- Functions and variables are not part of global scope
- Loaded into memory only once

#### Cons
- this keyword handling
- Separate definition of function and prototype


### Module Pattern
This pattern is one of the most common patterns used from the four pattern. This is based on exposing the set of functionalities of module through an APIs.

This pattern is used when we do not want to expose the private members of the module. 


```javascript
var Module = function() {
   // private variables
   // private funtions
   
   return {
      public variables and functions
   }
}
```

*Example*

```javascript
var Car = function(speed, type) {
   // private variables	
	var speed = ko.observable(speed);
	var type = ko.observable(type || "No type");		

	// private functions
 	var printSpeed = ko.computed(function() {
      console.log(speed());
 	});

	return {
       // public members and functions
		drive: printSpeed
	};
}

// Later in code
var car = new Car("bmw");
car.drive(60);
```

#### Pros
- Does not expose private functionality of the ViewModel
- Exposes only selective amount to the View
- View-ViewModel have a cleaner and fixed set of attributes available

#### Cons
- Testing Private functionality is difficult
- View and view model need to be in Sync
- Function and variables are in memory
- Debugging becomes difficult


### Revealing Module Pattern
The revealing module pattern is very close to the module pattern by its implementation but the only difference between them is that you create a singleton module. In order to do that you declare the module and wrap it inside an IIFE.

```javascript
var Module = (function () {
   // private variables
   // private functions
     return {
     // public members and functions
     };
}());
```

*Example*

```javascript
var car = (function(speed, type) {
   // private variables	
	var speed = ko.observable(speed);
	var type = ko.observable(type || "No type");	

	// private functions
 	var printSpeed = ko.computed(function() {
      console.log(speed());
 	});

		return {
       // public members and functions
		drive: printSpeed
        }
}(20, "bmw"));

// Later in code
car.drive(60);
```

#### Pros
- It is a cleaner way to expose the public interface.
- You have only a single instance of the module.

#### Cons
- Ability to extend such modules is difficult
- They have to be extended through external files/dependencies else they have to be self contained


## Utility Methods

It's not at all mandatory to use utility methods of KnockoutJS. And I recommend not to use them. Since we are already using AMD, we can load lodash/underscore library and they have numerous number of complex functionalities that we cant even think of. 

The reason we are pushing for not using this is Knockout is a bit old. The set of complexities demanded on front end have shooted up. And hence, lodash/underscore comes in handy.
For reference, all of the Knockout's utility functions are available in lodash/underscore.

Another utility library is MomentJS. This library can be used for anything and everything related to date and time. Be it, format, conversion, addition, subtraction, future, current and past operations.

These kind of library help us focus on the business logic and less worry about the smaller stuff.

Best utility libraries recommended to be used with an MVVM framework:
    1. [Lodash](//lodash.com/)
    2. [Underscore](//underscorejs.org/)
    3. [MomentJS](//momentjs.com/)
