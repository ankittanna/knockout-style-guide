# Knockout Style Guide
This is an opinionated style guide for KnockoutJS syntax, best practices, ease of use and understanding code, structuring large KO applications. They are designed for making the code testable, reusable and flexible for large scale development. 

## Contribution
I would invite the community to add their best practices and make learning Knockout a quick and easy job along with quality coding. You can also provide your feedback on the listed practices and we are always open to accept the best reasonable answer.

## Purpose
This style guide will be a list of guidelines on how to structure Knockout code and what things are needed to be considered while building a MVVM application. Inviting other users to share their knowledge. [@TheTanna](//twitter.com/TheTanna)

This guide is explicitly for syntax, conventions and structuring of the Knockout Application. These are based on my experience working with this framework and delivering trainings as wells as seminars. If you wish to learn some basics about Knockout, please refer to the documentation [KnockoutJS](//knockoutjs.com/)

##Open Community
You will never learn alone from your own business scenarios. Go to [StackOverflow - KnockoutJS](//stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/knockout.js) where you'd come accross thousands of questions describing various scenarios of other people. If you cannot contribute, you can gain some knowledge from their questions. 

##Guide
All we need to know is where to use which feature and how it would be useful to us. Once we know this then we would be able to fit the leggo bricks of a giant structure very easily.
